# Authentication-Project
 
This is a toy project to practice different ways to ensure secure login information for a given user. Eventually I'd like to add hashing in the event the "database" is compromised, and even past that, two-factor authentication. In the meantime, it's additional experience building a functioning program, which is always a good thing. 

As I work on it and improve it, the code will be cleaner, but for now I'm focused mostly on development speed, given that I'm the only one working on this and it's just for my own edification.
